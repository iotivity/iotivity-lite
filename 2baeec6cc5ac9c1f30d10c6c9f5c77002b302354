      "message": "Sorry for what is probably a dumb question (I don\u0027t have a lot of practice reviewing patches so the formatting is hard to follow).  But I am surprised that this functionality is not also in the previous patch... seems like verify_top() is basic functionality needed in any version.  Any simple explanation why this is new in the 2.16 patch?",

The update is nonobvious and need to be investigated to be merged properly, so I\u0027ve decided to keep the former code in case of enabled EXPANDED_SUBJECT_ALT_NAME_SUPPORT meanwhile.",
