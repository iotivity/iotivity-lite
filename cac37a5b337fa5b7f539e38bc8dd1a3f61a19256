      "message": "I am really strongly considering no longer exposing the freeServerEndpoints.  This relies on the first element of the array being a linked list so it can be passed to the oc_free_server_endpoints function.  We have no clear way to know that the endpoints will always remain a linked list.\n\nin java a for loop can be created to free the endpoints using the freeEndpoint function instead of using the free server endpoints.",
