This has actually been cleaned up in my in-progress patch with some other changes and should be posted soon.\n\nBasically, otm_rdp() needs to pass in the device name in the data parameter to the PIN OTM API and in addition this callback needs to do the following here:\n    add_device_to_list(uuid, (const char *)data, owned_devices);",

      "message": "Yes you are correct I did this as a workaround for the fact that the Random uuid changes (see patch set 2). I solved the issue by passing the device name as the data void* and fixed it for the justworks but missed it in the otm_rdp_cb. I have a follow up commit, fixing it for rdp as well.\n\nSee https://gerrit.iotivity.org/gerrit/c/iotivity-lite/+/29567",
