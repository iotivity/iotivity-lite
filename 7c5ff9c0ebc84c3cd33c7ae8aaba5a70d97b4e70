It is not used to store the scope of the address (as in link-local, global, etc.).\n\nAlso, the oc_string_to_endpoint() function is called only from oc_discovery.c while handling an oic/res response, where the actual, platform specific scope id, if known, is set in the resulting oc_endpoint_t. You can see this in oc_discovery:oc_ri_process_discovery_payload.",
