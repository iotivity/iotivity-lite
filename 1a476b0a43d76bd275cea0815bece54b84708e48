      "message": "Reason looks like Jaehyun wants to use encrypted buffer (from network event) for putting decrypted data. As mbedtls does not support inbuffer decryption he is using one auxiliary buffer \u0027g_decrypt_data\u0027. Other reason is network thread should wait for the buffer for next read, in the original code network event buffer will be released once message is decrypted and network thread will be free to read next message even though logically we have not processed the decrypted message yet. check that \u0027oc_message_add_ref\u0027 which makes buffer not to get destroy even after decryption is done.",
