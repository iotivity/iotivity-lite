1) Set CONTIKI path in the Makefile.

2) Perform the build:
make SERVER=1 <additional options you normally pass; eg. TARGET=...)
This selects the apps/server_contiki sample.
Specify CLIENT=1 instead to select the apps/client_contiki sample.
Add DEBUG=1 to include debug output from IoTivity-Constrained.
