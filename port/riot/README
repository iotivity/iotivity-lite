1) Set RIOTBASE path in port/riot/Makefile.

2) Perform the build:
Run export BOARD=native && make CLIENT=1 (or make SERVER=1)
CLIENT=1/SERVER=1 selects the client_riot/server_riot sample.
Add DEBUG=1 to include debug output from IoTivity-Constrained.

3) Setup a tap interface:
sudo ip tuntap add tap0 mode tap user ${USER}
sudo ip link set tap0 up

4) Run the application:
bin/native/ocf_app.elf tap0

client_riot/server_riot may be tested against the server_linux and
client_linux samples.
