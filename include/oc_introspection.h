/**
 * @brief functions for introspection .
 * The introspection mechanism is implemented by 2 different mechanisms
 * 
 * The first mechanism is reading the IDD file from a location.
 * The file is read with standard c library (fopen, fread, ..) 
 * The IDD information is served up as encoded CBOR contents (e.g. read as is).
 * The file is read and passed to the requesting client on each call.
 * if the file size is to big for the buffer, then an internal error is given back.
 * note that this option can serve up more than 1 introspection file, if multiple devices are implemented.
 * This feature is enabled when the compile switch OC_IDD_FILE is used.
 *
 * The second option is to use an include file that contains the IDD information.
 * This is the default mechanism.
 * The include file is called "server_introspection.dat.h" and should contain
 * introspection_data_size : size of the array introspection_data
 * uint8_t introspection_data[] : hex data representing the IDD.
 * one should place this file in a folder that gets included in the build
 * for example the include directory.
