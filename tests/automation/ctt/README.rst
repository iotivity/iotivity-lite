Steps to be followed to Run TAF Agent along with CTT
----------------------------------------------------

- The test case numbers(e.g., CT1.1.1, CT1.2.10 etc.,) of test cases on CTT that
  need to be run, have to be mentioned in the ``server_config.txt`` file present
  in ``iotivity-constrained/tests/automation/ctt``

- Move to ``iotivity-constrained/tests/automation/ctt`` and open a terminal from
  within that folder

- Run ``./run_taf_agent.sh`` to execute run_taf_agent.sh and install the
  dependent packages

- Run ``make`` to generate tafagent.exe

- Run the tafagent using ``./tafagent server_config.txt 1 6 11 1.3 1 6``

    [Arguments passed in the above command(from left to right) are to make
     below mentioned selections
     1 for QOS_CON
     6 for IPv6
     11 for security
     1.3 for OCF version 1.3
     1 for choosing 'Create Normal Resource' option on CertificationApp
     6 for choosing 'Create Group Resource' option on CertificationApp]

- Then open CTT, click on ``Test Run``>``Automation``

- Set the appropriate ``NetworkInterface``

- Set the following port values

  - ``Basic API port`` as: 32000

  - ``Extended API port`` as: 32001

  - ``Setup API port`` as: 32002

- Set ``Remote IP address`` be the IP address of Linux machine that runs the
  tafagent

- Then select ``Basic API``, ``Extended API`` and ``Setup API`` by clicking
  corresponding check boxes.

- Then click ``Connect``

- CTT then connects to TAF agent, following which TAF agent would communicate
  with CertificationApp.
