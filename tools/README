Both tools, pre-commit and check-style, use clang-format to fix the code style.

In order to use the tools one should copy the file "_clang-format" to the
project's root dir. This file contains the description of the iotivity-constrained code
style and will be used by clang-format.

The check-style tool can fix the code style of the project's file or only print
the changes. If no parameter is given the files are automatically fixed, to only
print the changes the option "-p" should be given.

automatically.  To use this tool one have to copy this file to
<project-root-dir>/.git/hooks/
