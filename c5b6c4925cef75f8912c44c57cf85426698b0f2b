I only ask because everywhere else oc_storage_config is called the call is surrounded by #ifdef OC_SECURITY guards.  The cloud_linux (renamed to cloud_server in this commit) is one of the only samples that does not use the ifdef guards. I was wondering if they should be used in the cloud_server sample?",
